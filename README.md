# Team Uchida

List of participants and affiliations:  
- Cathy Dobbs (Joliet Junior College)- flex  
- Karla Fuller (Guttman Community College - CUNY)- writer  
- Natasha (Natalie) Minkovsky (Community College of Baltimore County) - team leader  
- Lia Walker (Chowan University) - resource specialist  
- Kaitlin Bonner (St. John Fisher University) - resource specialist

# Target Audience
This activity is appropriate for introductory genetics college students (adaptable for more advance study or related course topics like Physiology, Microbiology, etc)

# Project Summary
The goal of this activity is for students to understand that most human phenotypes are controlled by genes at multiple loci. Students will use NCBI databases to explore gene variants implicated in Type 2 Diabetes and evaluate gene characteristics such as pathogenicity, type of mutation, 3D structures, to understand the clinical significance of mutations. Although this activity is designed for Type 2 Diabetes, it can easily be adapted to other diseases/phenotypes.

# Curricular Package Details

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
- Navigate the MedGen and ClinVar databases inside of the NCBI Clinical Hub
- Describe the significance of variant classifications (ie. pathogenic/non-pathogenic, associated/not-associated with the disease of interest, ie.)
- Explain how different types of mutations can contribute to disease/different phenotypes
  
## Course Materials
Specify the resources developed, including lesson plans, activities, worksheets, presentations, etc. List file names, including file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).

## Assessments
Explain how student learning will be evaluated (e.g., quizzes, assignments, projects).

## Future Work
This activity can be extended to include the use of BLAST search to compare mutation locations among variants.

# NCBI Codeathon Disclaimer
This project was created as part of the BioEd Summit Curricula-thon, a week-long event focused on collaborative development of data-driven learning experiences. While we encourage you to explore and adapt this project, please be aware that NCBI does not provide ongoing support for it.
