# Target Audience
This activity is appropriate for introductory genetics college students (adaptable for more advance study or related course topics like Physiology, Microbiology, etc).
.
# Project Summary
The goal of this activity is for students to understand that most human phenotypes are controlled by genes at multiple loci. Students will use NCBI databases to explore gene variants implicated in Type 2 Diabetes and evaluate gene characteristics such as pathogenicity, type of mutation, 3D structures. Although this activity is designed for Type 2 Diabetes, it can easily be adapted to other diseases/phenotypes.

# Curricular Package Details

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
- Navigate the MedGen and ClinVar databases inside of the NCBI Clinical Hub
- Describe the significance of variant classifications (ie. pathogenic/non-pathogenic, associated/not-associated with the disease of interest, ie.)
- Explain how different types of mutations can contribute to disease/different phenotypes
- Evaluate the effect of mutations on protein structure and function.
